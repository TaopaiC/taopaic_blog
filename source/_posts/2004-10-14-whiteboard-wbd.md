  <p>
    WBD is a shared whiteboard compatible with the LBL whiteboard, WB. Binaries are available for MS Windows 95/98/NT4, as well as Solaris2.5 and Irix6.2. It was originally written by Julian Highfield at Loughborough University and has since been modified by Kristian Hasler at UCL. This version has also been designed to work with the ReLaTe integrated interface.
