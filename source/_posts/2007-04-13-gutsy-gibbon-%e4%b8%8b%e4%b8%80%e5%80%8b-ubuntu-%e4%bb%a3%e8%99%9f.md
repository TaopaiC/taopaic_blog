> **Highlights from the announcement**:
> 
> 1.  The Gibbon defeated the “Glossy Gnu” to the finish
> 2.  This next version will also feature a brand new ultra-free, no-nonfree flavor of Ubuntu for the purists
> 3.  Glossiness in the form of Beryl/Compiz enabled by default might hit the Gibbon
> 4.  Any “monkey” should be able to install Gibbon &#8211; with new improvements to the installer to allow network-managed upgrades
> 5.  Agility of deployment, together with integrated management will be a focus for the Ubuntu server team &#8211; leading to leaner, meaner and faster server version of Ubuntu
> 6.  GNOME 2.20.0 will definitely be in Gutsy Gibbon, with GNOME 2.20.1 being a distinct possibility
